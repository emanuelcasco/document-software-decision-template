# Title

## 1) Executive Summary

A **brief** summary (a paragraph or a bullet list) that quickly explains what is the proposal about.

## 2) Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome? What motivates this proposal and why is it important?

## 3) Detailed design

Here is where we shine âœ¨, the core of our proposal. In this section we have to explain in detail **what** is our proposal about and **how** we are planning to implement it. Consider:

- Including code examples.
- Add diagrams to illustrate your ideas.
- Add links to other documents if needed.

As you see you can separate it in sections, the hierarchy is free, you can organice it as you want.

#### 3.1) Subtitle

Complete me!

##### 3.1.1) This topic is more specific

Complete me!

#### 3.3) Additional Notes

For this section, I recommend to use a list describing additional info, maybe constraints or non-functional requirements, that does not directly affects your proposal (otherwise they should be in `Detailed design`).

## 4) Impact and Dependencies

Here, we aim to be mindful of our environment and generate empathy towards others who may be impacted by our decisions.

- What other systems or teams are affected by this proposal?
- How could this be exploited by malicious attackers?
- Do your proposal has any drawback?

## 5) Rationale and Explored Alternatives

- What other designs have been considered?
- Why is this solution the best option?
- What is the rationale for not choosing the other alternatives?
- What is the impact of not implementing this proposal?

## 6) Unresolved questions

- What parts of the proposal do you expect to resolve through the RFC process?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?
